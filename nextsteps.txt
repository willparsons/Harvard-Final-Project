DJANGO WEBSOCKET PROTOCOL @lymotas
    - Users should be able to see when the other person is typing

    - Users should select friends to make a room with
    - Can select up to 9 additional people for a group room

Websocket
    - We should find a way to change the way we access rooms
    - The url solution is somewhat weird (chat/room_name)
    - Rooms should not be constrained to the name associated with them,
        they should be infinite and private (not accessible via url)
