User interface
    - Look into bootstrap further for an optimal design spec for this context
        - Maybe articles?

    React
    - We can have a base layout for how the pages are populated,
        but the messages will be made via components

    Current
    - Currently col-8 of relative feed (dm, group, etc)
    - Col-4 sidebar containing user navigation between dm, group, etc

Handling conversations
    - Messages contain author, recipient, content and timestamp
    - When messages are sent we can use send_message

Friends
    - Initially we should add friends directly via their username (since they are unique)
    - Then we can show recommended friends (mutual friends)
    - We need friend requests

Setup messaging API
    - We can GET the messages from request.user to another user based on user_id
    - Need a POST handler to send messages

DJANGO WEBSOCKET PROTOCOL @lymotas
    - Users should be able to see when the other person is typing
    - And once the message is sent it should update on our end without a page refresh

Look into Node for the realtime stuff


Git
    - remove the fucking pycache
